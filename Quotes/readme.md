# Highlights, Insights and quotes from the books I read

## Richard Hamming
 - Book: **The Art of Probability for Scientists and Engineers**
   - Since the answers are already known the purpose of the Examples and Exercises **_cannot be to get the answer_** but to illustrate the methods and **_style of thinking_** 
   - Probability is too important to be left to the experts [Quote]
   - How can there be laws of probability? Is it not a contradiction? Laws imply regularity, while probable events imply irregularity. We shall see that
 many times amid apparent irregularity some regularity can be found, and furthermore this **_limited regularity_** often has **_significant_** consequences.
   - Mathematics is not just a collection of results, often called theorems; it is a style of thinking [Quote]
   - Computing is also basically a _style of thinking_. Similarly, **_probability_** is a style of thinking
   - The experts, by their very expert training and practice, often miss the obvious and distort reality seriously.
   - We daily see doctors who treat cases but not patients, mathematicians who give us exact solutions to the wrong problems, and statisticians who give us verifiably      wrong predictions.
   - The desire of the experts to publish and gain credit in the eyes of their peers has distorted the development of probability theory from the needs of
     the average user.
    - In the past science has developed mainly from attempts to _"measure how much,"_ to be more precise than general statements such as larger, heavier,
      faster, more likely, etc. Probability tries to _measure more precisely_ than "more likely" or "less likely."
    - Thus all thought is, in some sense, modeling
    
 - On Models
      - A model is not _reality_, it merely helps to _explain some of our impressions of reality_. For example, for many purposes we assume that a table is "solid," yet in physics we often assume that it is made of molecules and is mainly "empty space." Different models may thus seem to contradict each other, yet we may use both in their appropriate places.
      - Selecting Criterion
          - Assumptions: Occam's razor (not an absolute truth)
          - Aesthetic: Some theories or nicer than others (depends on age, culture,...)
          - fruitfulness: Does the model suggest many new things to try?
  - Randomness
       - Randomness is a negative property; it is the absence of any pattern (we reject the idea that the *_absence of a pattern is a pattern_* and for set theory
formalists this should be considered carefully)
       - Randomness can never be proved, only the *_lack of it_* can be shown
       - We use the absence of a pattern *_to assert that the past is of no help in predicting the future_*, the outcome of the next trial
  - On Scholarly thinking
       - If we wish to escape the medieval scholastic way of thinking then we must make a model, compute what to expect, and then verify that our model
is (or is not) closely realized in practice (except when using "loaded dice")
  - **Revisit**
       - Rolling three dice and the interpretation of the distribution function of the sum of the outcomes (k = 3 to 18), page 60, example 2.4-4

  ## Mastery
   - Once you master a concept or a subject, you must _question_ the fundamental conceptions to push the field further
   - In ML
     - All Inputs are typically viewed as vectors or points in a high-dimensional space 
     - Models: A mapping from inputs to outputs
     - NNs are function approximators
