## Open Research Problems That Interest Me
1. Invariance property
    - Currently, NNs can be made invariant to transformations such as (in the context of CV) illumination, rotation, scale, deformation,.. using data augmentation.
    - However, data augmentation requires training (fine-tuning). How can we introduce such invariance to pre-trained networks?
    - How do we make a pre-trained model robust without additional parameter tuning?
